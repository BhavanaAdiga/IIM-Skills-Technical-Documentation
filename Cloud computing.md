# **API ON CLOUD COMPUTING**


# **1.   INTRODUCTION**

Cloud computing is the practice of offering computing and communications-related services using remotely located, network-based resources without requiring the user to possess those resources. Data, software, storage, security, and other services are among the resources provided.

The infrastructure is a "Cloud," which allows businesses and individuals to access applications on demand from anywhere in the world.
A cloud is what we call a network of nodes like this. A cloud application is one that is built on top of such clouds.

A cloud architect, who is frequently employed by a cloud integrator, creates the systems architecture for the software systems involved in cloud computing delivery, such as hardware and software. Several cloud components routinely communicate with one another via **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**, the most prevalent are the web services.

# **7.	Services of Cloud Computing**


## 7.1  SaaS: Software as a Service

Users can access software or apps hosted in the cloud via a **Web interface** (browser). Users can use these services without worrying about the internals of the applications or the infrastructure that was used to deploy them.

Facebook and Gmail are two examples.

## 7.2	DaaS: Data as a Service

Data from a variety of sources and formats can be smoothly put in the cloud. Users create and retrieve data in the same way they would on their own computers, with the exception that it is eventually saved on the cloud.

Google Docs and Adobe buzzword are two examples.

## 7.3	IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service


The term "infrastructure" refers to a cloud compute or execution service. It is made possible by virtualization technology, which allows for the splitting and sharing of infrastructure resources as well as scaling up and down according to client needs.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, for example.

## 7.4	Paas: Platform as a Service


A cloud platform service provides its users with an application development environment that allows them to construct cloud applications and examines the cloud's low-level information. It's similar to a programming language that hides the technical specifics of the operating system and underlying hardware from programmers.

Consider the Google App Engine.



# **8.	Benefits from a cloud**

Cloud computing has the potential to be a more cost-effective paradigm for supplying processes, apps, and services and also simplifies IT management by improving business responsiveness.
Cloud computing can help businesses innovate more quickly by giving simple computing services to users "**on demand**," independent of their location or device.
Information services, entertainment-oriented services like video on demand, simple business services like customer authentication or identity management, and contextual services like location or mapping services are well positioned to be supplied via the cloud.



# **9.	 Data security for cloud computing**

Working in the cloud with an external network provides the benefits of offsite storage backup, but it also comes with some risks: Viruses, spam, spyware, and identity theft .Despite the fact that many businesses now provide cloud vendors access to their data, "simply sharing a document rather than a complete infrastructure is a big gain.Keepthe cloud API keys safe.It requires the provider to submit keys for various kinds of data and risk levels. Put the development data in one account and the production data in another. As a result, the chances of someone breaking into the less secure development workstation are reduced.


## 9.1 Pay as you go

•	This can be used in a computing infrastructure to reduce the capital costs of setting up and operating a cluster of machines. To make this work, the cloud system needs to keep track of resource utilization at the granular level so that suitable bills can be generated.

•	Pay for cloud services only as needed to avoid competitors racking up the bill. 

## 9.2	Reduce endpoint reliability

--> The cloud's concept is to keep data on endpoint devices to a minimum.Endpoint devices are difficult to safeguard because they take security out of the hands of specialists and place it in the hands of users.

--> Ensure that data transactions are compliant and certified.

-->SaaS 70, a security protocol, should be followed in corporate situations. As medical data moves via the cloud, health care organizations require HIPAA laws.

## 9.3 Understand vulnerability management

Providers must be able to manage the vulnerability of a single piece of data that impacts a large number of clients because "a single vulnerability has the potential to divulge the essential assets of a large number of their clients." According to expert, "cloud computing providers must be able to demonstrate that they are aware of the cloud's vulnerabilities and are not waiting for someone else to disclose them."


## 9.4  Keep forensics and Weblog :

--> Providers must always know where their customers' data is. A process must be in place to trace the audit trail and see where the data was at any given time. 

--> Enable logging to gain insight into how users are using the cloud services that is deployed.



# **10. Conclusion**

To compete in today's worldwide competitive market, businesses must innovate and make the most of their resources. This necessitates providing platforms and collaborative tools that encourage creativity to its staff, business partners, and users. Cloud computing infrastructures are next-generation platforms that can benefit businesses of all sizes. They may assist businesses in making better use of current IT hardware and software investments, as well as speed the adoption of new technologies.

       Cloud computing improves resource use, which enhances profitability. Costs are reduced by just offering appropriate resources for the period they are required. Teams and companies have been able to shorten lengthy procurement processes because to cloud computing.
Cloud computing facilitates invention by removing the need for innovators to locate resources.
