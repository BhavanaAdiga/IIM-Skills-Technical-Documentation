# **API ON CLOUD COMPUTING**

# **1.   INTRODUCTION**

Cloud computing is the practice of offering computing and communications-related services using remotely located, network-based resources without requiring the user to possess those resources. The Internet is usually, but not always, the network in question. Data, software, storage, security, and other services are among the resources provided.
The infrastructure is a "Cloud," which allows businesses and individuals to access applications on demand from anywhere in the world.
A cloud is what we call a network of nodes like this. A cloud application is one that is built on top of such clouds.
