# **API ON CLOUD COMPUTING**

# **1.   INTRODUCTION**

Cloud computing is the practice of offering computing and communications-related services using remotely located, network-based resources without requiring the user to possess those resources. The Internet is usually, but not always, the network in question. Data, software, storage, security, and other services are among the resources provided.
The infrastructure is a "Cloud," which allows businesses and individuals to access applications on demand from anywhere in the world.
A cloud is what we call a network of nodes like this. A cloud application is one that is built on top of such clouds.

A cloud architect, who is frequently employed by a cloud integrator, creates the systems architecture for the software systems involved in cloud computing delivery, such as hardware and software. Several cloud components routinely communicate with one another via application programming interfaces (APIs), the most prevalent of which being web services.

# **7.	Services of Cloud Computing**

7.1  SaaS: Software as a Service

Users can access software or apps hosted in the cloud via a Web interface (browser). Users can use these services without worrying about the internals of the applications or the infrastructure that was used to deploy them.

Facebook and Gmail are two examples.

7.2	DaaS: Data as a Service

Data from a variety of sources and formats can be smoothly put in the cloud. Users create and retrieve data in the same way they would on their own computers, with the exception that it is eventually saved on the cloud.

Google Docs and Adobe buzzword are two examples.

7.3	IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service


The term "infrastructure" refers to a cloud compute or execution service. It is made possible by virtualization technology, which allows for the splitting and sharing of infrastructure resources as well as scaling up and down according to client needs.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, for example.

7.4	Paas: Platform as a Service


A cloud platform service provides its users with an application development environment that allows them to construct cloud applications and examines the cloud's low-level information. It's similar to a programming language that hides the technical specifics of the operating system and underlying hardware from programmers.

Consider the Google App Engine.

# **8.	Benefits from a cloud**

Cloud computing has the potential to be a more cost-effective paradigm for supplying processes, apps, and services while also simplifying IT management and improving business responsiveness.
Cloud computing can help businesses innovate more quickly by giving simple computing services to users "on demand," independent of their location or device.
Information services, entertainment-oriented services like video on demand, simple business services like customer authentication or identity management, and contextual services like location or mapping services are all well positioned to be supplied via the cloud.
